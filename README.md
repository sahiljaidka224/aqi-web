# Solution for Air Quality Index

## Introduction

- First thing, I added typescript to the project which helps in following the code easy and much easier to debug.

- Then I added storybook, which makes it easier to design components, eliminating the need to follow a path to get to a certain view

- Lastly, I added tests using Jest and enzyme.

## Design
